# Daikoku

Daikoku, in Japanese mythology, one of the Shichi-fuku-jin (Seven Gods of
Luck); the god of wealth and guardian of farmers. He is depicted in legend and
art as dark-skinned, stout, carrying a wish-granting mallet in his right hand,
a bag of precious things slung over his back, and sitting on two rice bags.
